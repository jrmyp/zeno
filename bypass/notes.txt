Sources :
    outputs from attelo print-probs
        MST
        MSDAG
    - those are in matrix form
    output from ILP
    - converted in triplets

Which form should be the basis for scoring ?
Intuitively, matrices
    If this is ever converted to numpy form
    scoring from direct matrix comparison is very efficient
No time for actual matrix creation, of course
Unless I got a spare hour in the week... so maybe ?
That may speed up thing, but I'll play it safe

Actual ids aren't even needed for evaluation !
They are for graph output though
    (I don't even know how to make it work =_=)

So, matrices only, with integers. Let's roll.

Ahem, actually, using sets is cleaner.
But only because we toss true negatives away
Surprisingly, very much cleaner

Dude. Test it.
