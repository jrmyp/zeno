Development notes
Remember everything
==
When installing Stac requirements, re-install educe and attelo
    so pip refers to the correct install path
    
irit-stac gather --help
    Doesn't work (could be useful...)
    
So apparently the config file in in the SVN
There : Stac/code/parser/stac-config ~

So, in order
    irit-stac gather
    attelo learn -C (conf) X.edu-pairs X.relations
    attelo decode -C (conf) -A att*.model -R rel*.model -o (zone) -d (decoder) X.edu-pairs X.relations
This is a long command...
A CLI could be useful, a config system maybe ?

To relaunch decoding, suppress score/counts in folders...
